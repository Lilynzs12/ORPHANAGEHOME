    <h2>Founder’s Role & Mission</h2>

    <div class="timeline-box">
        <span>Role as a Father</span>
        <p>
            Dr. Joseph plays the role of a father in monitoring the children’s growth
            and development. He is also actively involved in seeking funds to sustain
            the orphanage home.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-box">
        <span>Helping Broken Families</span>
        <p>
            Through his years of experience, Dr. Joseph has witnessed many broken
            families. Children are often neglected, abused, and abandoned due to
            parents being stressed and lacking experience in handling life challenges.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-box">
        <span>Beyond Shelter</span>
        <p>
            House of Love is not only a home for orphaned children, but also a
            protection place for single mothers. The single mothers’ protection
            home is administered by Christine Lim.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-box">
        <span>Ultimate Goal</span>
        <p>
            House Of Love was established not only to provide free shelter and care
            for children, but also to guide parents through counseling and support.
            The ultimate goal is for children to return to a stable, loving, and
            reunited family one day.
